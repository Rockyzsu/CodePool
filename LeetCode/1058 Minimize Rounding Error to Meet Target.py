"""
Given an array of prices [p1,p2...,pn] and a target, round each price pi to
Roundi(pi) so that the rounded array [Round1(p1),Round2(p2)...,Roundn(pn)] sums
to the given target. Each operation Roundi(pi) could be either Floor(pi) or
Ceil(pi).

Return the string "-1" if the rounded array is impossible to sum to target.
Otherwise, return the smallest rounding error, which is defined as
Î£ |Roundi(pi) - (pi)| for i from 1 to n, as a string with three places after the
decimal.



Example 1:

Input: prices = ["0.700","2.800","4.900"], target = 8
Output: "1.000"
Explanation:
Use Floor, Ceil and Ceil operations to get (0.7 - 0) + (3 - 2.8) + (5 - 4.9) =
0.7 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 1.0 .
Example 2:

Input: prices = ["1.500","2.500","3.500"], target = 10
Output: "-1"
Explanation:
It is impossible to meet the target.


Note:

1 <= prices.length <= 500.
Each string of prices prices[i] represents a real number which is between 0 and
1000 and has exactly 3 decimal places.
target is between 0 and 1000000.
